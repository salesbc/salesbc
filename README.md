Hi, I'm Brian Sales and I am taking the Vanderibilt Bootcamp class. I am a Physicist by training and make and study materials that are interesting and have unusual properties such as superconductors or magnets.
I have a research group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory called the "Correlated Electron Materials Group" and have been doing experimental research for the past 45 years. I am within a year or two of retiring
and I thought it would be interesting to learn something new- hence the Bootcamp class. I have been married for the past 47 years and have two grown children and 5 grandchildren.
My wife is a former psychiatrist, now retired, and has written and published three books. I enjoy most sports and still play basketball and kayaking. My wife loves riding her horse, writing, and quilting.
We live on a beautiful lake in East Tennessee.

Brian Sales
